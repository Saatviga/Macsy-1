Macsy
=====

Macsy is a framework for developing modular agents. Data is organised in blackboards. Computations are performed by modules that annotate the data in the blackboards. Modules communicate indirectly through the annotations that they leave in the blackboards. The framework enables the development of decentralised software agents for a plethora of applications.
